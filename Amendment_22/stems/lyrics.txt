[Chorus]
Constitution amendment twenty-two

Two terms maximum, that's all you can do

Power hungry minds will always construe

A loophole in the system to break through

[Verse 2]
History repeats with dictatorial dreams

FDR's legacy led to these safeguard schemes

Now another man claims exceptional means

To circumvent what democracy means

[Pre-Chorus]
The framers saw this coming

Checks and balances eroding

When ambition meets delusion

Democracy imploding

[Chorus]
Constitution amendment twenty-two

Two terms maximum, that's all you can do

Power hungry minds will always construe

A loophole in the system to break through

[Post-Chorus]
Break through! Break through!

They'll try to break through!
