Wake up America, smell the decay
Corporate vultures circling their prey
The Department of Education's been stripped away
Billionaires calling all the shots today

Textbooks burned, teachers purged
Ignorance praised, knowledge submerged
A calculated plan they've finally unleashed
To keep the masses dumb and on their knees

Education's on the chopping block
Corporate overlords with private stock
Tearing down what we built up
America's future going bankrupt

Hey! Hey! Hey! (Dumbed down!)
Hey! Hey! Hey! (Sold out!)

Billionaires with their twisted schemes
Dismantling schools for profit dreams
Children left behind, can't compete
While other nations surge ahead, we retreat

They cut the funding, cut the facts
A generation's future under attack
Critical thinking becomes a crime
As we watch our country's steep decline

Education's on the chopping block
Corporate overlords with private stock
Tearing down what we built up
America's future going bankrupt

Hey! Hey! Hey! (Dumbed down!)
Hey! Hey! Hey! (Sold out!)

Democracy crumbles when ignorance reigns
A population they can easily contain
No facts, no science, just propaganda flows
A calculated plan that nobody knows

Public schools shuttered, privatized gain
The wealthy get choices, the rest feel the pain
Tech bros and tyrants control what we learn
While textbooks and truth get thrown in to burn

Education's on the chopping block
Corporate overlords with private stock
Tearing down what we built up
America's future going bankrupt

Fight back! (Rise up!)
Fight back! (Stand up!)

Our children deserve more than their greed
Knowledge is power we desperately need
