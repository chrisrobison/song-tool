Remember Sunday morning, quiet, coffee steam outside my door
Now it’s sirens every hour, engines roaring, endless more
Traded blacktop for a promise, but the deal was one-way signed
Public vote without our warning, left our lives stuck in a line

Did you count the crashes climbing, families stranded on the curb
Shuffled papers, skipped the study, just pretend it’s not absurd

All the cars losing patience, jammed in front of my home
Prop K parks it for tourists, while we’re stuck in the zone
Sunset, Richmond left behind in endless horns and fumes
No one asked what happens here, democracy left the room

No way out now no way through
Overflow on avenues

Lines of metal never ending kids dodging double-yellow speed
Nights haunted by engines blending with ballots no one ever read or heeds
Where’s our air that’s not from tailpipes stacking up for blocks?
Shoved it through without a study, while they’re patting backs in talks

Said it’s green but crushed the green, the law was just a word
Ignored the folks who live here most, our voices never heard

All the cars losing patience, jammed in front of my home
Prop K parks it for tourists, while we’re stuck in the zone
Sunset, Richmond left behind in endless horns and fumes
No one asked what happens here, democracy left the room

No way out now no way through
Overflow on avenues
