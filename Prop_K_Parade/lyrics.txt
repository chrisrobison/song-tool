Used to cruise on weekends, friends on the beach
Now frustrated drivers fill every side street
What once was a shortcut is a nightmare now
All for a ribbon and a political vow

Proposition K got it wrong all along
We’re choking on the traffic as the parade rolls on
Cut off our veins to build their outdoor stage
Sunset and Richmond are burning with rage

Too loud too fast can't sleep can't last
Too loud too fast can't sleep can't last

Once we had peace off the Great Highway
Now it's gridlock on Tuesday, honking every day
Engardio smiled, called it progress for all
But hundreds of neighbors ignore his recall

No environmental study to say if we’re doomed
Just bikes and the blocs—another ballot consumed

Proposition K got it wrong all along
We’re choking on the traffic as the parade rolls on
Cut off our veins to build their outdoor stage
Sunset and Richmond are burning with rage

Too loud too fast can't sleep can't last
Too loud too fast can't sleep can't last
