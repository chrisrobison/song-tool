Billionaire alliance with a master plan
Twitter tycoon and the orange-tinted man
Dismantling the system with their golden wrench
Democracy's just collateral in their power trench

Public servants tossed aside like yesterday's trash
Programs frozen with a bureaucratic crash
They're selling us a future built on quicksand lies
While waving flags and feeding us their thin disguise[Chorus]
Democracy's on fire, going up in flames
Billionaires and tyrants playing power games
They're gutting institutions, one by one they fall
While we stand here watching as they tear down it all

Tear it down, tear it down
Watch it burn to the ground

Federal workers shown the door without a care
Budget freezes leaving families in despair
Departments disappearing overnight
History rewritten just to serve the right

They're deleting facts and changing what we see
Rewriting web pages of our history
The truth gets buried under corporate lies
As the last checks and balances slowly die

Democracy's on fire, going up in flames
Billionaires and tyrants playing power games
They're gutting institutions, one by one they fall
While we stand here watching as they tear down it all

Tear it down, tear it down
Watch it burn to the ground
