🎸 Melody & Tempo Guide
Tempo: ~185 BPM (fast and loose, à la NOFX’s Linoleum or Guttermouth’s Lucky the Donkey)
Key: E major (punk standard, easy power chords)
Song Structure:

Verse: Fast, palm-muted power chords with vocal melody that follows the chord roots

Pre-Chorus: More open strums, climbing feel

Chorus: Full, fast, driving—gang vocals on last line

Bridge: Spoken word (Guttermouth-style sass)

Chord Progressions:
Verse:
E - B - C#m - A
(straight 4-chord punk rock power progression)

Pre-Chorus:
F#m - G#m - A - B
(ascending, building tension)

Chorus:
E - C#m - G#m - A - B - E
(big and loud, classic pop-punk ring)

Vocal Melody Style:
Verse: Mostly talk-singing with attitude, kind of how Fat Mike lazily-but-cleverly drags his phrases (think “Linoleum”).

Chorus: More melodic—draw out the rhymes (“swap meeeet”, “screeeeam off beaaaat”)

Bridge: Full spoken/rant in character, exaggerated, sarcastic
