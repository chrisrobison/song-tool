We used to scream in basements, now we shout on Zoom
Still smell like sweat and PBR, just with a better costume
DIY tattoos, now barcodes on our merch
I didn't sell out, bro, I just got paid to do the work

They say we're hypocrites for making rent
But my moral high ground’s got a ten percent
So here's the truth they can't unspin:
We didn’t sell out — we just bought in

We bought in! Like suckers at a swap meet
Now we got benefits and dental when we scream off beat
We bought in! Still flipping off the system
But now we itemize the rage — 'cause adult life's a prism

I still hate the man, I just invoice him monthly
My band’s on TikTok — it’s ugly but comfy
That crust punk purity? A noble little lie
I’d rather own a house than eat trash pie

Yeah we still laugh at corporate hacks
But we got LLCs and union backs
So save your ‘poser’ violin —
We didn’t sell out, we just bought in

We bought in! Got stock in our rebellion
With matching punk retirement plans and stickered Hellions
We bought in! Now we pay for the distortion
We got sold the dream — and bought a punk proportion

"Yo I still hate cops, but I am the HOA president now...
My backyard punk fest ends at ten — noise ordinance, you know?
I’m not a sellout. I just bought a second fridge,
One for oat milk, one for rage."

We bought in! And yeah, the checks don’t bounce
Still scream the truth, just with accountant counts
We bought in! Still smashing with precision
Call it punk 2.0 — with a dental plan and vision

So keep your gate, your scene, your sacred clout —
We didn’t sell out…
We just bought[Outro]
So keep your gate your scene your sacred clout —
We didn’t sell out…
We just bought in.
